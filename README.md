# Custom Lab Hardware


Various designs I've needed over the years. Some is openscad, for 3d printing, some are just vectors for laser cutting.


### 6-24 well plate lid height adjuster

We needed to adjust the height of some plates. This fits between the wells of
a 6, 12, or 24 well plate, and functions as a "nut" into which a stainless bolt
can be screwed, providing "legs" for the plate.

### Syringe holder

This should be cut into 5mm thick acrylic, and forms a rack to hold 12 10mL
syringes, with reusable filters attached. We used this while sampling epiphytic
bacteria from plants in the field.
